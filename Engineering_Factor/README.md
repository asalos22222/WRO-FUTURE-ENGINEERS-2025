# Engineering Factor

This section highlights the engineering work and design innovation in our robot.

Key aspects:

- Modular chassis design created in FreeCAD.
- 3D printed structural reinforcements for optimized weight and durability.
- Precision mechanical integration (custom STL parts for servo mount, frame, etc.).
- Efficient electrical integration with a clean wiring layout.
- Use of AI vision and advanced sensors for enhanced perception.
- Optimized and well-documented control software.
