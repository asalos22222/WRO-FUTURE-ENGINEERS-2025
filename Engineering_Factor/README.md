# Engineering Factor

This section highlights the engineering work and design innovations that went into building our self-driving robot for the WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition.

## Mechanical Design

- The robot features a fully modular chassis, designed entirely in **FreeCAD** and manufactured using **3D printing**.
- The chassis is composed of multiple precision-engineered parts:
  - Base plate
  - Middle plate
  - Top plate
  - Servo lever
  - Front and rear supports and brackets
  - Rotating support parts
- These components were optimized for:
  - Durability and strength under dynamic loads
  - Lightweight construction for efficient movement
  - Ease of assembly and modular replacement

## Included Engineering Materials

- **3D Models (.STL files) and 3DProject.jpeg image**:
  - All CAD files used to produce the robot components are provided both in this folder and in `/models/` for full transparency and reproducibility.
- **Electrical Diagram**:
  - The complete electromechanical diagram (`ElectricDiagram.png`) is included, showing all electronic components and their connections.
- **Insight.md**:
  - A detailed written description of the robotâ€™s architecture, design decisions, and component choices is included (`insight.md`), copied here for convenience.

## Engineering Innovations

- **Modular Frame Design**:
  - The chassis was designed with modularity in mind, allowing for quick adjustments and part replacements during testing.
- **Custom 3D-Printed Parts**:
  - Strategic use of additive manufacturing provided both mechanical strength and design flexibility.
- **Optimized Weight Distribution**:
  - Component placement was carefully planned to achieve balance and stability.
- **AI-based Perception Integration**:
  - The engineering design took into account the positioning of the **HuskyLens AI Vision Sensor**, **Ultrasonic Sensors**, and **Compass**, optimizing their fields of view and minimizing interference.
- **Clean Wiring Layout**:
  - The internal wiring was designed for ease of debugging and robustness during competition runs.
