# Obstacle Management

This section documents the robot's obstacle management system.

Features:

- Dynamic obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.
- AI-based decision making using HuskyLens for object recognition.
- Adaptive navigation strategies implemented in Arduino code.

Software behavior:

- Automatic turning when obstacles detected within threshold distance.
- Lane keeping with color sensor.
- Advanced strategies using compass for orientation.

Demonstration video:
