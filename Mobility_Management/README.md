# Mobility Management

This section documents the mobility management of our robot.

Key points:

- Drivetrain: DS3230 PRO servo motor for forward propulsion (600 RPM).
- Steering: dedicated servo motor for sharp and precise turns.
- Motor driver: L298N for motor control.
- Software: optimized movement control (straight line navigation, turns) implemented in Arduino code.

Relevant code:
- See `src/` folder (Obstacle Challenge and Open Challenge code).

Performance:
- The drivetrain ensures a stable and agile movement, capable of navigating complex courses smoothly.
